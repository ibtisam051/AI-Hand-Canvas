## 🧠 How It Works

AirDraw uses **MediaPipe Hands** to detect and track 21 landmarks on your hand in real-time.  
These landmarks are processed to detect specific finger positions, which are mapped to actions like drawing, color change, or clearing the canvas.

**Core Logic:**
- **MediaPipe Hands** → Real-time hand detection & tracking  
- **Gesture Recognition** → Finger positions determine user intent  
- **Canvas Rendering** → Smooth drawing using the HTML5 canvas API
